# Understanding the template

The generated project has the following structure:

- `src/main`: This directory contains the operator scala files.
- `crd`: This directory contains the CRD definition.
- `yaml`: This directory contains the CRD yaml files.
- `project`: This directory contains the build properties and plugins.

Please explore the directories to understand the project structure in detail.
