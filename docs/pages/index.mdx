# Welcome to Kubernetes Scala Operator Scaffold

Welcome to the KSO project! This project provides a robust Kubernetes Operator Scaffold written in Scala designed to streamline the process of deploying and managing Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) on Kubernetes. It simplifies the creation of custom resources and leverages the power of Scala's advanced features to offer a type-safe, concurrent, and high-performing solution for Kubernetes resource management.

## Features

- Use ZIO and the power of Scala to create a type-safe, concurrent, and high-performing Kubernetes Operator.
- Use the Kubernetes ZIO Client to interact with the Kubernetes API.
- Use the Kubernetes ZIO Operator to create and manage Custom Resource Definitions (CRD).
- Auto generate Scala source from CRD at build time.
